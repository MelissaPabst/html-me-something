    <p>After a long day of travel, we arrived in San Jose around 8pm. Driving at night in Costa Rica is not recommended, but we did it anyway--guidebooks be damned. The late drive to La Fortuna took about 4 hours, and was a harrowing journey of winding roads completely devoid of signage. We broke down and bought a data plan just to have navigation! $100 well spent. We arrived at our hotel around 1am. After a good night's sleep, we woke up to an amazing view of the Arenal volcano</p>
    <p>La Fortuna introduced us to amazing wildlife (iguanas, howler monkeys, sloths, coati mundis, and birds). We hiked a trail around the volcano, bathed in hot springs, toured a coffee and chocolate manufacturer, and drove around Lake Arenal. </p>
    <p>On our way out of town, we sought out a waterfall.</p>
    <p>We were once again late arrivals to our hotel in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca. The following day we went for a walk along the beach. It's a very "hippie" town with a reggae-caribe vibe, popular with surfers.</p>
    <p>An overcast day brought us to Manzanillo National Refuge. The sea was super rough. It wasn't great hiking terrain, as it was extremely muddy.</p>
    <p>Being so close to the Panamanian border, we decided to go to Panama and drove to Sixoala to cross the border. With the guidance of a stranger (whom we were convinced was trying to scam us), we simply walked across the border without going through immmigration. Probably not smart on our part, but we lived to tell the tale.</p>
    <p>An odd highlight of the trip was getting pooped on by a giant grasshopper at an outdoor dinner.</p>
    <p>Our main reason for wanting to visit Costa Rica (which may sound pathetic) was to see baby sloths. We did the insiders tour at the famous <a href="http://www.slothsanctuary.com/" target="_blank">Sloth Sanctuary</a>. </p>
