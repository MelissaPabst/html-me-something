    <p>After a long day of travel, we arrived in San Jose around 8pm. Driving at night in Costa Rica is not recommended, but we did it anyway--guidebooks be damned. The late drive to La Fortuna took about 4 hours, and was a harrowing journey of winding roads completely devoid of signage. We broke down and bought a data plan just to have navigation! $50 well spent. We arrived at our hotel around 1am. After a good night's sleep, we woke up to an amazing view of the Arenal volcano</p>
    <p>La Fortuna introduced us to amazing wildlife (iguanas, howler monkeys, sloths, coati mundis, and birds).</p>
